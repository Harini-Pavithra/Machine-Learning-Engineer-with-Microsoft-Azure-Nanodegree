# Operationalizing Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure

In this project, we will work with the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://github.com/Harini-Pavithra/Machine-Learning-Engineer-with-Microsoft-Azure-Nanodegree/tree/main/Operationalizing%20Machine%20Learning/Dataset). we will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. we will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.Both the Azure ML Studio and the Python SDK will be used in this project.

# Steps Involved

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7.Create and publish a pipeline
